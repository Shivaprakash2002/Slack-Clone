As a beginner I need to develop a project to enhance my skills so I decided to implement my knowledge what I have learn by developing real time applications . hence i choose slack page to recreate its User Interface
and the Slack page I build have one register and Login page to handle the end users visiting.

Register page :
  It has input fields to collect the user data and it will be store in local storage
  The main motive of register page is to collect multiple user data respectively

  Login page :
   This page will get the data first then it validates with existing register page data to check wheather the users
   are true.If it successfully matched then get the user to Slack page..
